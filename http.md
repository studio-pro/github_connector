# HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It is an application-layer protocol that enables the transfer of various types of data between clients (usually web browsers) and servers.

## Key Features of HTTP

1. **Stateless**: Each request is independent and doesn't retain information from previous requests.
2. **Client-Server**: Clear separation between the client (requester) and server (provider) roles.
3. **Connectionless**: After a request is completed, the connection between client and server is closed.

## Common HTTP Methods

- GET: Retrieve data from the server
- POST: Submit data to be processed by the server
- PUT: Update existing data on the server
- DELETE: Remove data from the server

## HTTP Status Codes

HTTP responses include status codes that indicate the outcome of the request:

- 2xx (Success): The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted
- 3xx (Redirection): Further action needs to be taken to complete the request
- 4xx (Client Error): The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled
- 5xx (Server Error): The server failed to fulfill a valid request

## HTTPS

HTTPS (HTTP Secure) is an extension of HTTP that uses encryption for secure communication. It's essential for protecting sensitive data during transmission.

HTTP continues to evolve, with HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 introducing performance improvements and new features to meet the demands of modern web applications.
